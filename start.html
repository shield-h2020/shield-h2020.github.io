					You will need to prepare your environment beforehand.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance, your <strong>NFVI</strong> will require one or more VIM (as supported by OSM; namely OpenStack, VMware vCloud Director, AWS and OpenVIM -- we used OpenStack Ocata), SDN controller (ODL Carbon), NFVO (OSM release FIVE). You will also need to install Apache Spot for the DARE component to run.
				</p>
				<p>
					On a lower level you will also need to configure your hardware (whether it is to install the base Operating System, to install a TPM-based firmware in a switch or perform any configuration on a TPM-enabled server); as well as interconnect it properly to conform your infrastructure or testbed.

				<span class="start-steps">Install each component</span>

				Go through the README file available in the repository of each component. Look also for information on the <a href="{{ 'installing.html' | prepend: 'installation/' }}">installation guide</a>.

			<p class="start-steps-content">
				<span class="start-steps">Apply configurations</span>
			</p>
			<p class="start-steps-content">
				The components previously installed must be configured before these can run. Check out the sample configuration files provided in the repository of each component, copy them into the final configuration file and update the templated values with your own. Again, refer to the installation guide for further details.

				<p>
					Upon a successful configuration and proper set-up of the environment, it is time to run all the components and perform manual tests to verify proper integration between the components in the SHIELD platform.
				</p>
				<p>
					For instance, you may call a REST endpoint in the vNSFO API to start a workflow that involves several components and assess the final outcome against the expected one.
